***Usage Example***: 

It looks like I couldn't retrieve the specific contents of the Get-MitreAttTech.ps1 file. However, I can help explain what a PowerShell script file typically contains:

Functions and Cmdlets: PowerShell scripts often include custom functions or cmdlets to perform specific tasks.
Parameters: Scripts can accept parameters to customize their execution.
Pipeline Processing: Scripts may process input from the PowerShell pipeline.
Error Handling: There might be mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.
Comments and Documentation: Scripts should include comments to explain what each part of the script does.
If you can provide more details or context about the script, I can help with a more specific explanation.
